taking the physics approach rn.
Imagine the towers to be charged particles that are attracted to cities but repelled by other towers.
Towers that hold control of more cities are considered to be more massive.
The mass of a tower is only dependent on the number of cities for which it is the sole provider.
Once a tower becomes a provider to 0 cities, it goes away.
once a city is covered by a tower it no longer attracts other towers?
The ideas of mass may not make a lot of sense.
The forces acting on the towers should match up with the problem specification.
Towers should only feel a repulsive force when they are within the penalty radius of another tower.
Towers should only feel attraction towards uncovered towers?
Towers can have some sort of binding energy with the cities?
The binding energy is gained by joining with a city as well.
The binding energy is only for towers for which it is the sole provider.
Towers are free to move around as long as they do not leave any of their coresponding towers uncovered.
The above rule can be enforced through the binding energy.
How many towers to have?
Where should the towers be at when initialized?
How are towers created and destroyed?

Is there ever a situation where having more towers is better?


Greedy:
for each point calculate how many cities a tower could serve if placed there.
Place tower at highest place and decrement all the corresponding places.
Repeat till all cities covered.
